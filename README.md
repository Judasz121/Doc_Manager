# Doc_Manager
A web app for tracking document flow in a company.
It first started as a college project and after some time my client decided that he wants to implement it in a company that he works for,
so many changes had to be made ( including file structure ),
( some of the smaller changes were made by my client  so not everything in this project is made how I would normally do it )
